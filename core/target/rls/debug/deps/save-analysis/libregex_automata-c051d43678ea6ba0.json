deterministic finite automata.\nIt supports a rich syntax with Unicode support, has extensive options for\nconfiguring the best space vs time trade off for your use case and provides\nsupport for cheap deserialization of automata for use in `no_std` environments.\n\n# Overview\n\nThis section gives a brief overview of the primary types in this crate:\n\n* A [`Regex`](struct.Regex.html) provides a way to search for matches of a\n  regular expression. This includes iterating over matches with both the start\n  and end positions of each match.\n* A [`RegexBuilder`](struct.RegexBuilder.html) provides a way configure many\n  compilation options for a regex.\n* A [`DenseDFA`](enum.DenseDFA.html) provides low level access to a DFA that\n  uses a dense representation (uses lots of space, but fast searching).\n* A [`SparseDFA`](enum.SparseDFA.html) provides the same API as a `DenseDFA`,\n  but uses a sparse representation (uses less space, but slower matching).\n* A [`DFA`](trait.DFA.html) trait that defines an interface that all DFAs must\n  implement.\n* Both dense DFAs and sparse DFAs support\n  [serialization to raw bytes](enum.DenseDFA.html#method.to_bytes_little_endian)\n  and\n  [cheap deserialization](enum.DenseDFA.html#method.from_bytes).\n\n# Example: basic regex searching\n\nThis example shows how to compile a regex using the default configuration\nand then use it to find matches in a byte string:\n\n```\nuse regex_automata::Regex;\n\nlet re = Regex::new(r\"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\").unwrap();\nlet text = b\"2018-12-24 2016-10-08\";\nlet matches: Vec<(usize, usize)> = re.find_iter(text).collect();\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![(0, 10), (11, 21)]);\n```\n\n# Example: use sparse DFAs\n\nBy default, compiling a regex will use dense DFAs internally. This uses more\nmemory, but executes searches more quickly. If you can abide slower searches\n(somewhere around 3-5x), then sparse DFAs might make more sense since they can\nuse significantly less space.\n\nUsing sparse DFAs is as easy as using `Regex::new_sparse` instead of\n`Regex::new`:\n\n```\nuse regex_automata::Regex;\n\n# fn example() -> Result<(), regex_automata::Error> {\nlet re = Regex::new_sparse(r\"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\").unwrap();\nlet text = b\"2018-12-24 2016-10-08\";\nlet matches: Vec<(usize, usize)> = re.find_iter(text).collect();\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![(0, 10), (11, 21)]);\n# Ok(()) }; example().unwrap()\n```\n\nIf you already have dense DFAs for some reason, they can be converted to sparse\nDFAs and used to build a new `Regex`. For example:\n\n```\nuse regex_automata::Regex;\n\n# fn example() -> Result<(), regex_automata::Error> {\nlet dense_re = Regex::new(r\"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\").unwrap();\nlet sparse_re = Regex::from_dfas(\n    dense_re.forward().to_sparse()?,\n    dense_re.reverse().to_sparse()?,\n);\nlet text = b\"2018-12-24 2016-10-08\";\nlet matches: Vec<(usize, usize)> = sparse_re.find_iter(text).collect();\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![(0, 10), (11, 21)]);\n# Ok(()) }; example().unwrap()\n```\n\n# Example: deserialize a DFA\n\nThis shows how to first serialize a DFA into raw bytes, and then deserialize\nthose raw bytes back into a DFA. While this particular example is a bit\ncontrived, this same technique can be used in your program to deserialize a\nDFA at start up time or by memory mapping a file. In particular,\ndeserialization is guaranteed to be cheap because it will always be a constant\ntime operation.\n\n```\nuse regex_automata::{DenseDFA, Regex};\n\n# fn example() -> Result<(), regex_automata::Error> {\nlet re1 = Regex::new(r\"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\").unwrap();\n// serialize both the forward and reverse DFAs, see note below\nlet fwd_bytes = re1.forward().to_u16()?.to_bytes_native_endian()?;\nlet rev_bytes = re1.reverse().to_u16()?.to_bytes_native_endian()?;\n// now deserialize both---we need to specify the correct type!\nlet fwd: DenseDFA<&[u16], u16> = unsafe { DenseDFA::from_bytes(&fwd_bytes) };\nlet rev: DenseDFA<&[u16], u16> = unsafe { DenseDFA::from_bytes(&rev_bytes) };\n// finally, reconstruct our regex\nlet re2 = Regex::from_dfas(fwd, rev);\n\n// we can use it like normal\nlet text = b\"2018-12-24 2016-10-08\";\nlet matches: Vec<(usize, usize)> = re2.find_iter(text).collect();\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![(0, 10), (11, 21)]);\n# Ok(()) }; example().unwrap()\n```\n\nThere are a few points worth noting here:\n\n* We need to extract the raw DFAs used by the regex and serialize those. You\n  can build the DFAs manually yourself using\n  [`dense::Builder`](dense/struct.Builder.html), but using the DFAs from a\n  `Regex` guarantees that the DFAs are built correctly.\n* We specifically convert the dense DFA to a representation that uses `u16`\n  for its state identifiers using\n  [`DenseDFA::to_u16`](enum.DenseDFA.html#method.to_u16). While this isn't\n  strictly necessary, if we skipped this step, then the serialized bytes would\n  use `usize` for state identifiers, which does not have a fixed size. Using\n  `u16` ensures that we can deserialize this DFA even on platforms with a\n  smaller pointer size. If our DFA is too big for `u16` state identifiers, then\n  one can use `u32` or `u64`.\n* To convert the DFA to raw bytes, we use the `to_bytes_native_endian`\n  method. In practice, you'll want to use either\n  [`DenseDFA::to_bytes_little_endian`](enum.DenseDFA.html#method.to_bytes_little_endian)\n  or\n  [`DenseDFA::to_bytes_big_endian`](enum.DenseDFA.html#method.to_bytes_big_endian),\n  depending on which platform you're deserializing your DFA from. If you intend\n  to deserialize on either platform, then you'll need to serialize both and\n  deserialize the right one depending on your target's endianness.\n* Deserializing a DFA requires the use of `unsafe` because the raw bytes must\n  be *trusted*. In particular, while some degree of sanity checks are\n  performed, nothing guarantees the integrity of the DFA's transition table\n  since deserialization is a constant time operation. Since searching with a\n  DFA must be able to follow transitions blindly for performance reasons,\n  giving incorrect bytes to the deserialization API can result in memory\n  unsafety.\n\nThe same process can be achieved with sparse DFAs as well:\n\n```\nuse regex_automata::{SparseDFA, Regex};\n\n# fn example() -> Result<(), regex_automata::Error> {\nlet re1 = Regex::new(r\"[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\").unwrap();\n// serialize both\nlet fwd_bytes = re1.forward().to_u16()?.to_sparse()?.to_bytes_native_endian()?;\nlet rev_bytes = re1.reverse().to_u16()?.to_sparse()?.to_bytes_native_endian()?;\n// now deserialize both---we need to specify the correct type!\nlet fwd: SparseDFA<&[u8], u16> = unsafe { SparseDFA::from_bytes(&fwd_bytes) };\nlet rev: SparseDFA<&[u8], u16> = unsafe { SparseDFA::from_bytes(&rev_bytes) };\n// finally, reconstruct our regex\nlet re2 = Regex::from_dfas(fwd, rev);\n\n// we can use it like normal\nlet text = b\"2018-12-24 2016-10-08\";\nlet matches: Vec<(usize, usize)> = re2.find_iter(text).collect();\nassert_eq!(matches, vec![(0, 10), (11, 21)]);\n# Ok(()) }; example().unwrap()\n```\n\nNote that unlike dense DFAs, sparse DFAs have no alignment requirements.\nConversely, dense DFAs must be be aligned to the same alignment as their\nstate identifier representation.\n\n# Support for `no_std`\n\nThis crate comes with a `std` feature that is enabled by default. When the\n`std` feature is enabled, the API of this crate will include the facilities\nnecessary for compiling, serializing, deserializing and searching with regular\nexpressions. When the `std` feature is disabled, the API of this crate will\nshrink such that it only includes the facilities necessary for deserializing\nand searching with regular expressions.\n\nThe intended workflow for `no_std` environments is thus as follows:\n\n* Write a program with the `std` feature that compiles and serializes a\n  regular expression. Serialization should only happen after first converting\n  the DFAs to use a fixed size state identifier instead of the default `usize`.\n  You may also need to serialize both little and big endian versions of each\n  DFA. (So that's 4 DFAs in total for each regex.)\n* In your `no_std` environment, follow the examples above for deserializing\n  your previously serialized DFAs into regexes. You can then search with them\n  as you would any regex.\n\nDeserialization can happen anywhere. For example, with bytes embedded into a\nbinary or with a file memory mapped at runtime.\n\nNote that the\n[`ucd-generate`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ucd-generate)\ntool will do the first step for you with its `dfa` or `regex` sub-commands.\n\n# Syntax\n\nThis crate supports the same syntax as the `regex` crate, since they share the\nsame parser. You can find an exhaustive list of supported syntax in the\n[documentation for the `regex` crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.1/regex/#syntax).\n\nCurrently, there are a couple limitations. In general, this crate does not\nsupport zero-width assertions, although they may be added in the future. This\nincludes:\n\n* Anchors such as `^`, `$`, `\\A` and `\\z`.\n* Word boundary assertions such as `\\b` and `\\B`.\n\nIt is possible to run a search that is anchored at the beginning of the input.\nTo do that, set the\n[`RegexBuilder::anchored`](struct.RegexBuilder.html#method.anchored)\noption when building a regex. By default, all searches are unanchored.\n\n# Differences with the regex crate\n\nThe main goal of the [`regex`](https://docs.rs/regex) crate is to serve as a\ngeneral purpose regular expression engine. It aims to automatically balance low\ncompile times, fast search times and low memory usage, while also providing\na convenient API for users. In contrast, this crate provides a lower level\nregular expression interface that is a bit less convenient while providing more\nexplicit control over memory usage and search times.\n\nHere are some specific negative differences:\n\n* **Compilation can take an exponential amount of time and space** in the size\n  of the regex pattern. While most patterns do not exhibit worst case\n  exponential time, such patterns do exist. For example, `[01]*1[01]{N}` will\n  build a DFA with `2^(N+1)` states. For this reason, untrusted patterns should\n  not be compiled with this library. (In the future, the API may expose an\n  option to return an error if the DFA gets too big.)\n* This crate does not support sub-match extraction, which can be achieved with\n  the regex crate's \"captures\" API. This may be added in the future, but is\n  unlikely.\n* While the regex crate doesn't necessarily sport fast compilation times, the\n  regexes in this crate are almost universally slow to compile, especially when\n  they contain large Unicode character classes. For example, on my system,\n  compiling `\\w{3}` with byte classes enabled takes just over 1 second and\n  almost 5MB of memory! (Compiling a sparse regex takes about the same time\n  but only uses about 500KB of memory.) Conversly, compiling the same regex\n  without Unicode support, e.g., `(?-u)\\w{3}`, takes under 1 millisecond and\n  less than 5KB of memory. For this reason, you should only use Unicode\n  character classes if you absolutely need them!\n* This crate does not support regex sets.\n* This crate does not support zero-width assertions such as `^`, `$`, `\\b` or\n  `\\B`.\n* As a lower level crate, this library does not do literal optimizations. In\n  exchange, you get predictable performance regardless of input. The\n  philosophy here is that literal optimizations should be applied at a higher\n  level, although there is no easy support for this in the ecosystem yet.\n* There is no `&str` API like in the regex crate. In this crate, all APIs\n  operate on `&[u8]`. By default, match indices are guaranteed to fall on\n  UTF-8 boundaries, unless\n  [`RegexBuilder::allow_invalid_utf8`](struct.RegexBuilder.html#method.allow_invalid_utf8)\n  is enabled.\n\nWith some of the downsides out of the way, here are some positive differences:\n\n* Both dense and sparse DFAs can be serialized to raw bytes, and then cheaply\n  deserialized. Deserialization always takes constant time since searching can\n  be performed directly on the raw serialized bytes of a DFA.\n* This crate was specifically designed so that the searching phase of a DFA has\n  minimal runtime requirements, and can therefore be used in `no_std`\n  environments. While `no_std` environments cannot compile regexes, they can\n  deserialize pre-compiled regexes.\n* Since this crate builds DFAs ahead of time, it will generally out-perform\n  the `regex` crate on equivalent tasks. The performance difference is likely\n  not large. However, because of a complex set of optimizations in the regex\n  crate (like literal optimizations), an accurate performance comparison may be\n  difficult to do.\n* Sparse DFAs provide a way to build a DFA ahead of time that sacrifices search\n  performance a small amount, but uses much less storage space. Potentially\n  even less than what the regex crate uses.\n* This crate exposes DFAs directly, such as\n  [`DenseDFA`](enum.DenseDFA.html) and [`SparseDFA`](enum.SparseDFA.html),\n  which enables one to do less work in some cases. For example, if you only\n  need the end of a match and not the start of a match, then you can use a DFA\n  directly without building a `Regex`, which always requires a second DFA to\n  find the start of a match.\n* Aside from choosing between dense and sparse DFAs, there are several options\n  for configuring the space usage vs search time trade off. These include\n  things like choosing a smaller state identifier representation, to\n  premultiplying state identifiers and splitting a DFA's alphabet into\n  equivalence classes.
